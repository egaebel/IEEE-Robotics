notes for the two ArduinoColorRecognitionDriver libraries

Libraries downloaded from here:
https://github.com/dalmirdasilva/ArduinoColorRecognitionDriver

There are two different approaches here:
Using interrupts to increment a variable each time the line rises. Doing it from a while (van be 1 second) .
Using pulseIn method, collecting a given number of samples and making the average in order to calculate the frequency,

initialize takes as arguments the arduino pin numbers that are connected to the sensor out, S2, and S3 pins. VCC pin is connected to +5V and GND pin is connected to ground. All other pins are not necessary for the sensor to work.

There is a datasheet and there are code examples in the library subfolders.
